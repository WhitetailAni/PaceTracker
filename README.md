# PaceTracker
A simple Swift interface library for Pace's bus tracker API. Mostly designed around use with [Carmine](https://github.com/WhitetailAni/Carmine).

No API key is needed as this API is not originally intended for use by the public - I reverse engineered it by looking at JS files in their [tracker website](https://tmweb.pacebus.com/TMWebWatch/)

Please don't spam their API too much!

No idea how low this framework will support, please experiment
